2. Dependencies
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
exifotocopy needs jhead.
To use the GUI features zenity is needed.
To use on-the-fly image manipulation ImageMagick (convert) is recommended
To use the Configuration GUI you will need python and PyGTK installed (GTK >= 2.16)


3. Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
unpack the archive, cd to the exifotocopy directory and type

$ ./install.sh

to install everything as nautilus scripts.
You can also copy the script files to whereever you want, the configuration
file should be renamed to .exifotocopy and located in the user's home directory

If you don't want to install the whole GUI bunch and just want the bash script, type:

$ ./install.sh install

Here is the whole install.sh usage:

install [install|nautilus|uninstall] [destination]



Distributed files are:

exifotocopy.sh			main bash script
exifotocopy.py			GUI frontend
exifotocopy-install.sh	installation bash script
defaultcfg				default configuration file
plus some logo, localisation stuff...


4. Usage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exifotocopy is a tool to copy and/or (re)organize/ sort image files according to
their Exif Date information.
It is intended to be used as nautilus-script (GNOME file manager) but can
be used as standalone command line tool as well.

This script will create a folder structure depending on the Exif Date Information
of the source image files. You can have structires like this:

+ Year
|
+---+ Month
	|
	+---+Day

or a flat structure with each Folder representing a single day.
The script uses zenity for user interaction but this can be
disabled for use in non-graphical environments or if simply not desired.
In this case exifotocopy runs completely in the terminal.

The script takes optionally one parameter which is the source directory to
scan for image files. If omitted the current working directory is taken.


4. Configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
exifotocopy.sh reads all parameters from a configuration file located at
~/.exifotocopy/exifotocopyrc
which can be edited to suit your needs.

If installed as nautilus-script, a GUI Frontend will appear if you choose
ExiFotoCopy from the nautuilus-script menu, which allows to adjust all
settings before the script will be run.

The default configuration can be restored from the file defaultcfg
distributed with this archive. Just copy/rename it to ~/.exifotocopy to restore
the default settings.
